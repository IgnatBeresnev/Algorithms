# Algorithms & Data Structures
Here I'll be implementing the majority of popular algorithms and data structures that I know.

I'm also following **MIT's** [6.006 Introduction to Algorithms](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/) program. Here you can find given material implemented in Java
