# Algorithms & Data Structures
Here I'll be implementing the majority of popular algorithms and data structures that I know.

## Pull requests
If you want to push some Algorithm implementations / Data Structures of your own - I'm sorry, I will not accept it since this repository is intented for studying only. Therefore, I should go through every existing structure and algorithm myself.

**However**, if you want to correct some mistakes of mine or suggest/push **additional**  in-class implementations (for example, you know a recursive implementation of a method I have), you're more than welcome to do that.

## MIT 6.006
I'm also following **MIT's** [6.006 Introduction to Algorithms](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/) program. Here you can find given material implemented in Java.
