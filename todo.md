---------------- DISCLAIMER -------------------
You may notice that the todolist keeps growing,
and I rarely cross-out or do anything listed.
That's true. As of right now, I'm taking the
MIT's 6.006 course, and I implement algorithms
given on lectures. When I'm done with it, I'll
move onto the todolist and finish it off (ha-ha).
-----------------------------------------------

## Algorithms and data structures
- [ ] Add a binary insertion sort
- [ ] Add a greedy algorithm
- [ ] Red and black tree balancing
- [ ] Pigeonhole sort
- [ ] null sorting, null comparison
- [ ] add Matrix graph

## Other
- [ ] Correct javadoc, new format

## Done
- [x] Make a to do list.
- [x] AVL balancing + rotations
- [x] BST next largest/smaller (successor/predecessor)
- [x] Binary pow
- [x] Eratosthenes sieve (e-maxx.ru)
- [x] Do more fail-tests for sorting
- [x] Add class for hashcode generation
