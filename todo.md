---------------- DISCLAIMER -------------------
You may notice that the todolist keeps growing,
and I rarely cross-out or do anything listed.
That's true. As of right now, I'm taking the
MIT's 6.006 course, and I implement algorithms
given on lectures. When I'm done with it, I'll
move onto the todolist and finish it off (ha-ha).
